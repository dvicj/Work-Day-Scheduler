# Work Day Scheduler 

Please visit my completed webpage at:  https://dvicj.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/.

Hello, and welcome to my README! This is for my Week 5 Challenge, which was to create a work day planner. I learned a lot while doing this, and I am happy to be able to share my experience with you. 

It was my job to ensure my work day scheduler had the following features: 

	- when the planner is loaded, the current day is displayed at the top of the page 

	- there are time blocks for standard business hours (9am to 5pm)
    
    - each time block is colour coded. Ie. grey for the past, red for the present and green for the future

    - when time blocks are clicked, the user is able to enter a task

    - when the save button is clicked, then the text for that event is sae to local storage 
    
    - when the page is refreshed the entered task remains. 

<br>

I was to create this portfolio, and meet all of the requirements listed above, by using: 

	- HTML
    - CSS 
    - JavaScript
    - Web APIs
    - 3rd Party APIs - Bootstrap, Moment.js and jQuery
	
I completed this project as I wanted a simple and intuitive daily planner that could display information succinctly. Just by looking at the planner, the user is able to keep track of their day easily due to the colour coding. 

It is important that I am able to showcase what I can do in an interactive and meaningful way.

## Installation

There is no installation required. All files must remain in the position in which they are saved to ensure that all links, styles and photos function properly. 

Below are examples of the links for the CSS style sheet and the images used in this webpage.

## Usage
![quiz in action](insert gif here)

Here are some user experience highlights from my page: 

    - when the user loads the page they are presented with the current date and time (which updates every 60 seconds)

    - all time blocks are updated and color coded as time passes throughout the day. The blocks are grey for time blocks that have already passed, red for time blocks which match the current time of day, and green for time blocks in the future. 

    - when the user clicks on the save icon button, their task is saved to local storage and persists when the page is loaded.

## Learning
Here are the highlights of what I learned and issues I had while writing this code.

1. I really worked on saving to GitHub at least once an hour.This helped me greatly, as any issues I ran into were quickly and easily fixed as I had my old recent code to fall back on. 

2. I felt that I greatly improved on making my code simpler and easier to understand. I often struggle with making way too many variables when it's not necessarry.  

3. I really liked working with all of the 3rd party APIs, but I did find myself falling into the old patterns of using regular JavaScript and CSS styling. I think I will have to find a balance between using the libraries and my own code.
